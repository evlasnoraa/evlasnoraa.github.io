        <h1>Aaron Salve</h1>
        <h2>Data Scientist | Applied Mathematician | Problem Solver</h2>
        <p>My journey has always been fueled by an insatiable curiosity—whether it's unraveling the complexities of machine learning models or exploring the far corners of the world. From my early days delving into Applied Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego, to earning a Master’s in Data Science from the University of Bath, I’ve been captivated by the intersection of numbers, technology, and real-world impact.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I took an unconventional path. My role at Kaplan International College London began as a Sessional Mathematics Tutor, but within ten months, I was entrusted with the responsibilities of Academic Manager. In this leadership capacity, I spearheaded initiatives that led to record-breaking student satisfaction and academic performance. Whether mentoring a diverse team of educators, optimizing academic strategies, or making data-driven decisions, I embraced challenges with adaptability and strategic thinking.</p>
        
        <p>While I absolutely enjoyed my time at my old job, after working for two years in Academia, I came to a sudden realization that I am drifting further away from my first love – Data Science. I could see myself going back to teaching in the future, but I can’t see myself going back to Data Science if I stayed on that path. Hence, at this point in my life, I have made quite an extreme decision of switching career paths and going back to Data Science!</p>

        <p>Beyond the world of data and academics, you’ll often find me chasing adventure. I unwind by playing badminton, swimming, and feeding my wanderlust through travel. My blog—a work in progress—will soon be a mosaic of travel stories, starting with snapshots from my time in the UK.</p>

        <p>Curious to learn more? Feel free to explore the 'Projects' tab to see my hands-on work, or visit the 'Resume' section for a detailed breakdown of my academic and professional journey.</p>

        <p>Now, I’m eager to bridge my academic knowledge and leadership experience into the dynamic world of Data Science. I’m not just looking for a job; I’m on a mission to leverage data to solve complex problems and drive innovative solutions. Every dataset tells a story, and I can’t wait to uncover the next one.</p>

        <p>Let’s connect if you’re looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, discuss AI/ML advancements, or explore strategic opportunities.</p>
