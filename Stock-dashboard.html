        <h1>Stock Dashboard</h1>

        <p>This is a web app that is inspired by popular stock trading apps like Freetrade,
        Rise by Motilal Oswaal, and of course, Yahoo Finance. In this app, I have created a dynamic dashboard for any company available on Yahoo Finance that displays the stock price for the selected company over a time period that can be selected by the user. Additionally, I have also displayed summary statistics for different time periods that capture the stock performance. Finally, I display a 30-day forecast using the Holt-Winters Triple Exponential Smoothing algorithm.</p>

        <p>The "Recommendations" indicator is calculated using Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the respective stocks.</p>
        <p>The goal of this website was NOT to demonstrate my investment knowledge or UI/UX expertise. However, it was to demonstrate how a simple dashboard can be made quite easily within 2-3 days using tools like Streamlit. I also took this opportunity to practice my commenting skills on the .py file. So check it out! :)</p>

        <p>Try out the website! - <a href = "https://stock-dashboard-evlasnoraa.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">https://stock-dashboard-evlasnoraa.streamlit.app/</a></p>
